# sse-console
An exercise of providing alternative to the Skyrim SE console, the mod is on:
https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/?

## Development notes
As with the other sse-whatever projects this come as the next generation (6th in fact) and all of
them share source code in the `./share` folder. This one is packing much more in `./share/utils` 
and therefore it is a bit of mess due to its transition phase.
